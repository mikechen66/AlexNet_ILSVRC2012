Organise the ILSVRC dataset for training

Let’s take a look at the ILSVRC dataset. If you check the train directory, you will see 1,000 sub-directories, each of them holding images for a designated ImageNet category. The names of the sub-direcctories are quite strange. Therefore, users need to grab this file(https://github.com/juliensimon/aws/blob/master/mxnet/imagenet/synsets_with_descriptions.txt) to know what’s what, e.g. n01440764 is the category for fishes.
